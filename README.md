- LINUX & Mac: Both SCRCPY & ADB need to be installed to your computer per [your distro's instructions](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy#linux).

On macOS, you need to sync the dock path to the system path. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
launchctl setenv PATH $PATH
```
